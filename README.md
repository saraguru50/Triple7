TITLE:  Storm Prediction and Analysis using Artificial Neural Network

OBJECTIVE:
        The main objective of this project is to propose a methodology to develop a Storm analysis model from Rainfall dataset using techniques
such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Min-Max Algorithm. Storm analysis model aims at predicting the occurrence and strength of a
storm by analyzing the rainfall data of that region.

METHODS: 
        In the proposed methodology the rainfall dataset is being trained by Artificial Neural network (ANN) based on the three layers - 
Input, Hidden,and Output layers. The trained dataset is then summarized into a model which performs the prediction of storm centric
characteristics. Neural network training is implemented in Hadoop framework. We obtain a considerable improvement in
the total performance of the system by employing Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Min-Max algorithm is also used in the system for
predicting the intensity of storm. The dataset used for training and prediction consists of daily rainfall data.

FINDINGS: 
        In the existing system, the rainfall dataset is collected and stored in a relational database and then map-reduce based techniques 
are applied for storm analysis. The major disadvantages associated with this technique are the performance and accuracy rate get reduced
with increase in data size. In the proposed methodology as the rainfall dataset is being trained by Artificial Neural network (ANN) 
the performance and accuracy rate got improved. Also, the training process is done on multi-node hadoop cluster by considering large
rainfall dataset. With multi-node hadoop cluster there was a large reduction in the total training time. Storm depth of a
particular region is calculated by applying MIN-MAX algorithm. This improved the total efficiency of the storm intensity
prediction.
